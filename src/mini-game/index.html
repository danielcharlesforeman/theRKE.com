    <h1>Robot's vs Children Sant's Workshop</h1>
    <p>Version 0.5 Alpha -- <strong>note, due to chrome restrictions click mouse pointer or tap screen to play music!!</strong></p>
    <p>Santa's elves rebelled, so they were replaced with robots. The angry elves swore revenge and saboraged the robots, now they are running wild and hour before delivery! You and a team of other children must save as many presents as you can! Every present saved is another child Santa can visit.</p>
    <blockquote>Congratulations you've saved <strong id="score">0</strong> presents! You have <strong id="lives">3</strong> Lives left.</blockquote>
